Hello World!!! This is my first text's initial draft 

This quote just made my day 

"It always seems impossible, until it is done - Nelson Mandela"

- Chain of events:

Learned to revert changes using "revert" command.
Learned to reset changes using "reset" command.
Learned and understood "branching"

Git commands learnt until now:

git init
git status
git add
git commit
git log
git revert
	- optional parameter "-n" to indicate you want to control the commit
git branch <branch-name>
git branch 
	- list available branches
git checkout <branch-name>
