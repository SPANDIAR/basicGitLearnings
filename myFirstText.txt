Git commands learnt until now:

git init
git status
git add
git commit
git log
git revert
	- optional parameter "-n" to indicate you want to control the commit
git branch <branch-name>
git branch 
	- list available branches
git checkout <branch-name>
git merge <branch-name>
	- go to 1 branch and choose the branch you want to merge to branch 1
	- usually, merge is done with the source as "master"
merge conflicts
